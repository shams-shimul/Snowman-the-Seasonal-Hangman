# Snowman ☃️ The Seasonal Hangman

**🎯 JavaScriptmas 2024 challenge from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/ "target=_blank"), Day 8**

This tricky challenge is about creating a Christmas version of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. In this game, instead of a stick figure getting hanged if a player fails to guess a word within a limited number of attempts, a snowman will get vanished.

The 6 body parts of the snowman will be melting away with each wrong guess until it's totally gone and the game is lost. On the other hand, if the entire word is guessed correctly, not only the snowman will retain or restore body part lost due to any wrong guesses in between, it will pose in style with a pair of sunglasses to mark the win!

There will be a list of fun words specific to this festive season from which one will be randomly tossed in each round. No word will be repeated in a session until the list is depleted.

**Let's dive into building and playing another guessing game!**
